# Common Mistakes

**Packing too much.** You don't need to bring everything. Most situational items you can buy during your travel such as medication, extra clothes, 

**Budget airline limits**. Budget airlines usually have a weight limit of 7-10 kg and a size limit of 56 x 36 x 23 cm for carry-on items. Check your airline and pack accordingly.

**Liquids over 100mL** are not allowed onto flights. 

## The Backpack

There are 4 popular options for which bag to choose each with their own use-case.

**The duffel bag** is one of the lightest and cheapest options for a pack.

*can be purchased at a price of $15.00*


Best for:
- carrying under 35L
- 4 to 6 outfits
- staying under the airline weight limit
- travel duration of under 1 month

Note that:
- can be uncomfortable to carry
- some are a duffel/travel pack hybrid which offer more comfort

**The travel backpack** is designed for travel. A lot of them will feature added comfort, a laptop compartment, and a open-shell design for easy access to items.

Best for:
- carry around 40 to 45L
- 5 to 7 outfits
- carrying a laptop
- travel duration of less than 6 months

Note that:
- can be a lot heavier and hard to keep under 7 kg.

<br/>

**The hiking backpack** is perfect for carrying comfort and long duration trips. Offers plenty of space for buying souvenirs, more clothes, and luxury accessories such as hair straightener, portable drip coffee, etc.

- 8 to 12 outfits
- travel duration over 6 months

Note that:
- needs to be check during flight as they are over the carry-on limit
- access to items can be difficult if tightly packed.

<br/>

**Carry-on Suitcase** is back to the basics. Some backpackers will disagree, but this is a completely viable option and it just works.

<p style="text-align:right"><sub><sup>The Carry-On from Away</sup></sub></p>

Best for:
- carrying around 40L
- 5 to 7 outfits
- avoiding back pain from carrying heavy backpack
- city stays where taxi or sidewalks are convenient

Note that:
- hard to move on rough surfaces or navigate crowded streets
- can be inconvenient to open in a small hotel or hostel where space is limited


## Hygiene

A toiletry bag can organize and store all your hygiene items in one place. A ziplock bag works too. Most hotels/hostels will provide shampoo, body wash, and a towel so these items can be omitted from your pack if you prefer.

<p style="text-align:right"><sub><sup>Dopp Kit from Aer</sup></sub></p>

Here's a list of toiletry items I bring:

- toothbrush
- toothpaste
- floss
- contact lenses
- contact solution
- razor
- shaving cream
- deorderant/perfume

(optional)
- shampoo
- conditioner
- body wash
- hand cream
- lip balm
- face wash

## Outfits

You can always buy clothes when you're away. Even in expensive cities, clothing prices at Uniqlo are comparable. Take note of the weather and season. A lot of destinations have a wide selection of vintage or thrifting experiences.

- daily outfit 6x
- lounge wear 1x
- active wear 1x
- sweater or jacket 1x

For long haul trips, I like to carry 8 outfits. 6 daily fits, 1 active fit, and 1 lounge wear. This allows laundry to be done once a week. On days you don't sweat a lot, then it can be fine to wear the same clothes across 2 days which can give you 2 weeks before laundry is needed. During laundry days, I'm either in my lounge wear or active wear so I can renew all my daily outfits during the wash. Of course, the lounge wear needs to be washed as well, hence wearing the active wear when the lounge wear is being washed.

## Essentials

A phone to access the internet and a bank card or credit card to withdraw from the ATM.

- phone
- phone charger
- passport
- sunscreen
- credit card & bank card

## Accessories & Entertainment

Plugs for different countries are different so you might need an outlet converter. All of these you can buy while you're in another country. Remember to wear sunscreen when you're out especially midday when the UV levels are high.

- outlet converter
- book
- earphones
- playing cards
- sunglasses
- glasses case
- umbrella
- slippers
- towel

(optional)
- laptop
- portable charger

## Day pack

A 20L daypack is useful when you want to go to the beach or go on a 2 to 3 days trip while leaving your main backpack behind with the hotel or luggage check. A simple lightweight backpack will do the trick. A dry bag is a nice option if a lot of day trips may involve getting wet while hiking or on a boat.
